## ETL Process Description

This project implements a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using Python and various tools.

### Extract
The extraction process involves downloading data from the Spotify API. The data pertains to the user's listening history from the previous day.

### Transform
The transformation process involves validating the extracted data to ensure it meets certain criteria. This step is crucial to ensure that only clean and accurate data is loaded into the database.

### Load
The final step is loading the validated data into a database. This step ensures that the data is stored in a structured format for easy access and analysis.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the ETL process.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used for data transformation.
- **Spotify API**: Used to extract data related to the user's listening history.

### Files in the Repository
- **extract.py**: Contains the code to extract data from the Spotify API.
- **transform.py**: Contains the code to validate and transform the extracted data.
- **load.py**: Contains the code to load the validated data into the database.
- **.env.example**: A template for the environment variables required for the project. Users need to create a copy of this file and rename it to .env, then fill in their personal information.

## Setting Up the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Fill in your personal information (TOKEN, USER-ID, etc.).
3. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the ETL process by executing the main script (e.g., `python main.py`).

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet effective way to implement an ETL process using Python. By following the steps outlined above, you can set up and run the ETL process to extract, transform, and load data from the Spotify API into a database.
